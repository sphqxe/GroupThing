# GroupThing

The purpose of this web application is to provide a platform for developers to group together and receive ideas from the community/industry. It aims to connect people with ideas for applications but no development capabilities to groups of developers or individual developers who would like to work on projects but have no good ideas.

## DataStack

The planned stack for this application is as follows:
- Vue.JS with apollo-client integration for the frontend
- Apollo-server with express integration on the backend
- PostgreSQL Database, with the possibility of MongoDB for low-latency reactive data
